# NLP
For this expriment, I utilize NLP to analyze PEAD. Specifically, I transform corpus data into numeric data with the help of pretrained word2vec and BERT embedding layer. Then, I apply Tranformer and various Neural Networks to do text classification and conduct alpha factor. I successfully conduct a strategy with 40% annualized return and Sharpe ratio of 4.8.
